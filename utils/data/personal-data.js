    "I'm passionate about leveraging technology for impactful changeâ€”to make the world around me more efficient, healthier, and safer. I've interned at Crypto.com, Mastercard, and GovTech Singapore, gaining valuable experience. I've also developed projects like Sentry Scanner, a Chrome extension that combats scams on Web2 and Web3, which won the Crypto.com 2023 APAC Hackathon, and a mobile app for KK Hospital, aiding over 500 children in obesity management. When I'm not building, you can catch me playing futsal, hosting a gathering, or tackling the new Leetcode daily challenge.",
